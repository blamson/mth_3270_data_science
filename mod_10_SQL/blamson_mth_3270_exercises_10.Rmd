# NOTE
Any random extra query parameters were added due to either curiosity or a desire to shorten the query time. 

# Exercise 1

```{r}
db_con <-
    DBI::dbConnect(
        drv = MySQL(),
        dbname = "airlines",
        host = "mdsr.cdc7tgkkqd0n.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        user = "mdsr_public",
        password = "ImhsmflMDSwR"
    )
```

```{r}
# A

db_con %>% class()
```

The class is a MySQLConnection.

```{r}
# B

DBI::dbListTables(db_con)
```

There are four separate tables in the database.

```{r}
# C

# Described the contents of the airports table:
dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "DESCRIBE airports;"
) %>%
    nrow()
```

There are 9 fields in airports.

```{r}
# D

# Described the contents of the flights table:
dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "DESCRIBE flights;"
) %>%
    nrow()
```

There are 21 fields in flights.

# Exercise 2

```{r}
DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "SELECT carrier, tailnum 
                FROM flights
                LIMIT 0,5;"
)
```

# Exercise 3

```{r}
# A

my_carriers <-
    DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "
        SELECT *
        FROM carriers;
    "
)

my_carriers %>% is.data.frame()
```

Cool thing I learned passively googling is that you can just do SQL queries directly in a separate code chunk if you specify sql as the language and provide it the connection we created earlier. The output is a table that is very easy on the eyes. 

```{sql connection=db_con}
# Using SQL directly

SELECT * FROM carriers
```

```{r}
# B

my_carriers %>%
    object.size() %>%
    print(units = "Kb")
```

`my_carries` is approximately 235 kilobytes large.

# Exercise 4

```{r}
my_airports <-
    DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "
        SELECT *
        FROM airports;
    "
)
```

```{r}
# A and B

glue::glue("The airports data set has 
           {my_airports %>% nrow()} rows and {my_airports %>% ncol()} columns.")
```

# Exercise 5

DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "
        SELECT distance / air_time * 60 AS trvl_speed
        FROM flights
        LIMIT 0,5;
    "
)
```

```{sql connection=db_con}
# Using SQL directly

SELECT distance / air_time * 60 AS trvl_speed
FROM flights
LIMIT 5
```

# Exercise 6

```{r}
# A

DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "
        SELECT *
        FROM flights
        WHERE arr_delay > 120
        LIMIT 0,5;
    "
)
```

```{r}
# B

DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "
        SELECT year, month, day, dest
        FROM flights
        WHERE dest IN ('IAH', 'HOU')
        LIMIT 0,5;
    "
)
```

```{r}
# C

DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "
        SELECT dep_time, dep_delay, arr_delay, carrier
        FROM flights
        WHERE carrier IN ('UA', 'AA', 'DL')
        LIMIT 0,5;
    "
)
```

For fun I'll just use SQL directly on parts d, e and f.

```{sql connection=db_con}
# D

SELECT year, month, day
FROM flights
WHERE month BETWEEN 7 and 9 AND year = 2013
LIMIT 0,5;
```

```{sql connection=db_con}
# E

SELECT dep_time, arr_time
FROM flights
WHERE dep_time = 2400 OR dep_time BETWEEN 0 and 600 AND year = 2013
LIMIT 0,5;
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# F

DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "
        SELECT carrier, month, arr_delay
        FROM flights
        WHERE carrier = 'UA' AND month = 7 AND arr_delay > 120 AND year = 2013
        LIMIT 0,5;
    "
)
```

# Exercise 7

```{r}
# A

DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "
        SELECT carrier, MIN(dep_delay) AS minimum_delay
        FROM flights
        WHERE year = 2013 AND month = 6 AND day = 26
        GROUP BY carrier
        LIMIT 0,5;
    "
)
```

```{r}
# B

DBI::dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "
        SELECT carrier, MIN(dep_delay) AS minimum_delay, MAX(dep_delay) AS maximum_delay
        FROM flights
        WHERE year = 2013 AND month = 6 AND day = 26
        GROUP BY carrier
        LIMIT 0,5;
    "

```

# Exercise 8

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "SELECT carrier, dest, AVG(arr_delay) AS meanArrDelay
                FROM flights
                WHERE year = 2013 AND month = 6 AND day = 26 AND origin = 'BDL'
                GROUP BY dest;"
)
```

This selects the carrier and destination columns unchanged. It also creates a new column for the AVERAGE arrival delay for each destination. This selection only occurs on June 26th, 2013 where the origin of the flight was BDL. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "SELECT carrier, dest, AVG(arr_delay) AS meanArrDelay,
                AVG(distance) AS meanDist
                FROM flights
                WHERE year = 2013 AND month = 6 AND day = 26 AND origin = 'BDL'
                GROUP BY dest;"
)
```

This is the same as the previous example, but instead we also calculate the average distance for each destination.

EWR was the shortest.

# B

dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "SELECT dest, AVG(air_time) AS avg_travel_time

                GROUP BY dest
                ORDER BY avg_travel_time DESC
                LIMIT 0,5;"
)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

LAX was the longest average travel time.

ORD had the most flights.

Tailnumber `N128UW` had the most flights.
