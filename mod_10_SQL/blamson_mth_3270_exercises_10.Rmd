# Exercise 1

```{r}
db_con <-
    DBI::dbConnect(
        drv = MySQL(),
        dbname = "airlines",
        host = "mdsr.cdc7tgkkqd0n.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        user = "mdsr_public",
        password = "ImhsmflMDSwR"
    )
```

```{r}
# A

db_con %>% class()
```

The class is a MySQLConnection.

```{r}
# B

DBI::dbListTables(db_con)
```

There are four separate tables in the database.

```{r}
# C

# Described the contents of the airports table:
dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "DESCRIBE airports;"
) %>%
    nrow()
```

There are 9 fields in airports.

```{r}
# D

# Described the contents of the flights table:
dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "DESCRIBE flights;"
) %>%
    nrow()
```

There are 21 fields in flights.

# Exercise 3

my_carriers %>% is.data.frame()
```

Cool thing I learned passively googling is that you can just do SQL queries directly in a separate code chunk if you specify sql as the language and provide it the connection we created earlier. The output is a table that is very easy on the eyes. 

```{sql connection=db_con}
# Using SQL directly

SELECT * FROM carriers
```

```{r}
# B

my_carriers %>%
    object.size() %>%
    print(units = "Kb")
```

`my_carries` is approximately 235 kilobytes large.

For fun I'll just use SQL directly on parts d, e and f.

```{sql connection=db_con}

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Exercise 8

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "SELECT carrier, dest, AVG(arr_delay) AS meanArrDelay
                FROM flights

                GROUP BY dest;"
)
```

This selects the carrier and destination columns unchanged. It also creates a new column for the AVERAGE arrival delay for each destination. This selection only occurs on June 26th, 2013 where the origin of the flight was BDL. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dbGetQuery(
    conn = db_con,
    statement = "SELECT carrier, dest, AVG(arr_delay) AS meanArrDelay,
                AVG(distance) AS meanDist
                FROM flights
                WHERE year = 2013 AND month = 6 AND day = 26 AND origin = 'BDL'
                GROUP BY dest;"
)
```

This is the same as the previous example, but instead we also calculate the average distance for each destination.

`LEFT JOIN` returns everything that matches the query for the flights dataset. Rows that don't have information in the airports dataset are kept, just get NAs tacked onto stuff that doesn't apply. `JOIN` doesn't work that way, and will exclude rows that aren't in both. Based on `JOIN` returning one less, it can be assumed that there's one row that isn't in both.
