## Chapter 1: Prologue: Why Data Science
### 1.1 What is data science?

The authors define **data science** simply and broadly. They "see it as the science of extracting meaningful information from data" (Baumer et al, 4). 

This book appears to have a focus more on building *data acumen* than focusing on programming specifically. *Data acumen*, according to The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018, includes a variety of capacities such as:

---

"mathematical, computation and statistical foundations, data management and curation, data description and visualization, data modeling and assessment, workflow and reproducibility, communication and team-work, domain-specific considerations, and ethical problem solving."

---

This book will focus on techniques utilizing **R** and its packages **dplyr** and **ggplot2**, two packages I am all too familiar with at this point! 

The big hurdles to overcome with how data exists in the modern world is, according to the book, that it isn't collected in a way that may be useful to usual statistical tests like the t-test or ANOVA for instance. A lot of data out there is observational and was not collected at random which means different techniques are more appropriate here. The book refers to things like *predictive models*, interactive visualizations and *web applications* that allow for easier data exploration for the end user. 

That last part in particular has me interested as I have been working on a web application over the past month (Dec 2021 - Jan 2022) that has taught me how a data scientist would deliver a web application that may allow a data analyst to better do their job. Selling web applications for this purpose is an entire industry apparently! That's crazy.
