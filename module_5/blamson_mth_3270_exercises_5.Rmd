### Exercise 1:

```{r}
# A
sample_mean_vec <- c()

for(i in 1:1000) {
    sim_sample <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 50, sd = 15)
    sample_mean_vec <- c(sample_mean_vec, mean(sim_sample))
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
glue::glue("
    The mean of the sample mean vector is approximately {mean(sample_mean_vec) %>% round(digits = 3)},
    and the standard error of the vector is approximately {sd(sample_mean_vec) %>% round(digits = 3)}.
")
```
